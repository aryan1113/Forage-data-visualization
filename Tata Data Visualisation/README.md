<h3>Task 2 : Top 10 countries which generate highest revenue</h3>
<p>Revenue data is not directly available, so we use bar-plots to visualize Quantity and Unit Price of items.<br/> Revenue is simple Quantity * Unit Price, hence the country where Quantity and Unit Price of items sold is higher, the Revenue is higher too !  </p>

<h3>Task 3 : Find out the most valueable customer. </h3>
<p>We use a bar-plot to visualize customer-data, as data-values are discrete</p>

<h3>Task 4 : Find out countries where the company can expand their business</h3>
<p> Countries where presence is low/non-existent are regions where we can expand our presence </p>

 * In Southern-American region, we only have customers form Brazil, expanding our business to other regions has high growth potential
 * Majority of the African-continent is not covered by our services.
 * Non-existent presence in the Asian continent is a cause of concern, China and India can be huge drivers of growth.
